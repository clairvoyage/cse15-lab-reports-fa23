# Basics of Terminal Commands

## `cd` is short for “current directory”

1. When you type `cd` into the terminal without arguments, your working directory is changed to the root directory.
   > The output of this command is not an error because changing your working directory to the root directory is the default action of `cd`.   
   - In the below example, the working directory is `lecture1/messages`. When cd is entered without any arguments (that is, without any text after `cd`), the working directory is changed to the root directory, which is `lecture1`.
